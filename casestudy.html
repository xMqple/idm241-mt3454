        <!-- Overview -->
        <h2>
            Overview
        </h2>
        <p> This project is a microinteraction design to improve Nintendo's Game Tile on their website. This 
            was for Drexel's course, IDM-241. We were tasked to create 5+ microinteractions within an element while using languages,
            like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Over the past 10 weeks, I have created, think up ideas, developed an alpha, beta, and final for this class.
            Each of the build includes the descriptions of the triggers, rules, feedback, and loops & modes. </p>
        <!-- Context And Challenge -->
        <h2>
            Context And Challenge
        </h2>
        <p> Nintendo is a multinational consumer electronics and video game company headquartered in Kyoto, Japan. 
            Established in 1889, it originally produced handmade hanafuda playing cards before diversifying into various 
            entertainment ventures and, eventually, electronic gaming. It is one of the most prominent and influential 
            companies in the gaming industry. </p>

        <p> However there are some issues with the game card on their website, users are not able add items to the cart when they are on the card. 
            They have to directly click onto the card which may cause frustration to the user. They also could not see the genres 
            that are associated with game, making it difficult for users to see what type of game they would click into. There was also issues with the 
            hover state where the changes were slight (having the image banner mover 10px up and text color change). There should be a noticable difference when hovering
            over a game card. </p>

        <!-- Process and Insight-->
        <h2>
            Process And Insight
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Competitor Research
        </h3>
        <p> I began research other game websites like Steam, Epic games, Gamestop to see what they 
            were doing differently in their game card designs and overall user interface. This included 
            analyzing how they presented game information, structured layouts, implemented interactive features, 
            and prioritized accessibility. By identifying common trends and standout practices, I aimed to gather inspiration
            and pinpoint opportunities for Nintendo's game card improvement. </p>

        <h3>
            Alpha Build
        </h3>
        <p> For the alpha, my task was to mimic the original website's microinteraction. I had to code out the layout of the microinteraction
            which was the game card on Nintendo's page. I did the hover state of the game card, in which the game image moves 10px up and the 
            game title changes from dark gray to red. 
        </p>
        <div class="video">
            <video controls>
                <source src="videos/game-tile-microinteraction-alpha.mp4" type= "video/mp4">
            </video>
        </div>
        <h3>
           Beta Build
        </h3>
        <p> For the beta, my task was to add changes I would improve on for the microinteractions. We needed 1-2 microinteraction changes, in which
            I decided to have the heart button animation change when you hover it and the heart changes from dark grey to red when you click onto it.
            I also made it so that when you hover the game card, the whole card moves upward 10px and theres a drop shadow casted around the card to make the hover state more prominent.
        </p>   
        <div class="video">
            <video controls>
                <source src="videos/game-tile-microinteraction.mp4" type= "video/mp4">
            </video>
        </div>
        <h3>
            Final Build
         </h3>
         <p> For the final, I built off the beta and added two more microinteractions. The micro interactions i decided to include were the 
             add to cart button and the genre section since in the original, they didn't have any information about the game and did not include a 
             add to cart button for users to buy the game. The orginal had the user click onto the game card, which is an extra step for them.
         </p>     
         <div class="video">
            <video controls>
                <source src="videos/game-tile-microinteraction-final.mp4" type= "video/mp4">
            </video>
        </div>
        <!-- The Solution -->
        <h2>
            The Solution
        </h2>
        <p> I have developed various microinteractions to improve the original site. These interactions include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Game Tile </li>
            <li> Like Button - Default </li>
            <li> Like Button - Active </li>
            <li> Add To Cart Button </li>
            <li> Genre List </li>
        </ul>

        <p> 
            While developing these microinteractions, I wanted to make the hover state of the game card more prominent, add an add to cart button,
            and, add a genre list at the bottom of the card to include information about the game.
        </p>

    <!-- The Results -->
    <h2>
        The Results
    </h2>
    <p> 
        This project successfully achieved its objectives, delivering a functional working prototype for Nintendo's game card. 
        This addressed key pain points like having a prominent hover state on the game card, implement an add to cart button, and have genre titles for the game card.
