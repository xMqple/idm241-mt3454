<h2>
    Background And Challenge
</h2>
<p> Nintendo is a multinational consumer electronics and video game company headquartered in Kyoto, Japan. 
    Established in 1889, it originally produced handmade hanafuda playing cards before diversifying into various 
    entertainment ventures and, eventually, electronic gaming. It is one of the most prominent and influential 
    companies in the gaming industry. </p>
<p> However there are some issues with the game card on their website, users are not able add items to the cart when they are on the card. 
    They have to directly click onto the card which may cause frustration to the user. They also could not see the genres 
    that are associated with game, making it difficult for users to see what type of game they would click into. </p>

    Process
</h2>
<h3>
    Competitor Research
</h3>
<p> I began research other game websites like Steam, Epic games, Gamestop to see what they 
    were doing differently in their game card designs and overall user interface. This included 
    analyzing how they presented game information, structured layouts, implemented interactive features, 
    and prioritized accessibility. By identifying common trends and standout practices, I aimed to gather inspiration
    and pinpoint opportunities for Nintendo's game card improvement. </p>

<h3>
    Research Interviews
</h3>
<p> I conducted interviews to collect what specific pain points were common amongst users. </p>
